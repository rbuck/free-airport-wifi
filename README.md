# REMAC Free Airport WiFi Utility

Description
-----------

Most airports offer free WiFi, yet some of those time limit access, after which
you are prompted to provide credit card information for additional minutes. The
scheme works off the MAC of your WiFi network interface. By simply changing the
WiFi interface MAC address you can reconnect to airport WiFi and get additional
minutes free.

The script provided assigns a new randomly generated MAC address to the network
interface of your WiFi network interface. After running the script you are free
to reconnect to airport WiFi for additional free minutes. Simply repeat running
the script each time you get kicked out.
